Automate the process of copying the Selenium test files to a separate 
location and replacing the file path with one that works in the local 
environment.

REQUIREMENTS:
This script only attempts to replace the value of a given Selenium 
variable; thus, it will only replace the file path were it's stored
in the given variable name.

INSTALLATION:
1. Rename copy_selenium_config.default.sh to copy_selenium_config.sh
2. Edit copy_selenium_config.sh to set variables as documented inline.
